=== CHUNK 15 VALIDATION REPORT ===
Timestamp: 2025-08-25T17:20:12 IST
Session Duration: 29 minutes (10:01 PM - 10:30 PM IST)
Status: 100% SUCCESS - All objectives completed

=== PROBLEM RESOLUTION SUMMARY ===

1. INITIAL ISSUE: "No scheme supplied" Error

CHUNK 17 - SOURCE-TEMPORAL INTEGRATION VALIDATION REPORT
Hybrid Deep Learning with Explainable AI for Fake News Detection
=============================================================================

TIMESTAMP: 2025-08-25 17:58:45 IST
SESSION: Source-Temporal Feature Integration
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

=============================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

Objective: Integrate publisher credibility and timestamp normalization as 
          source-temporal features into the MHFN model for enhanced fake news detection

Scope: Backend enhancement with real-time pattern detection capabilities
Target: 100% accuracy in implementation and testing

=============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=============================================================================

1. DATA LOADER ENHANCEMENTS (data_loader.py)
   ✅ Publisher credibility encoding (0-1 scale)
      - BBC, Reuters, AP: High credibility (0.90-0.95)
      - Unknown sources: Default credibility (0.5)
      - 50+ trusted publishers mapped
   
   ✅ Timestamp normalization
      - Days since epoch / 365 normalization
      - Invalid timestamps default to current time
      - Range: [0, ~60] for realistic timeframes
   
   ✅ Source-temporal tensor creation
      - Format: [batch, 2] tensor [credibility, timestamp]
      - Integrated into preprocess_data pipeline
      - Key: 'source_temporal' in preprocessed data

2. MODEL INTEGRATION (model.py)
   ✅ MHFN class constructor updated
      - Added source_temporal_dim parameter (default: 2)
      - New source_temporal_fc layer for feature processing
      - Fusion layer to combine LSTM + source-temporal features
   
   ✅ Forward method enhanced
      - Optional source_temporal tensor input
      - Feature processing and concatenation
      - Maintains backward compatibility
   
   ✅ Predict method updated
      - Single prediction with source-temporal features
      - Proper tensor handling and type hints

3. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING
   ✅ Unit tests (test_source_temporal.py)
      - Publisher credibility encoding validation
      - Timestamp normalization testing
      - Tensor creation and shape verification
      - Model integration testing
      - Prediction influence validation
   
   ✅ End-to-end testing (test_source_temporal_e2e.py)
      - Complete pipeline validation
      - Performance benchmarking
      - Credibility influence analysis
      - Temporal influence analysis
      - Mock data processing
